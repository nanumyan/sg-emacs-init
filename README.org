* Introduction
Open Emacs, type =Alt+x help=, hit ENTER, then =t= (Emacs notation for the same would be =M-x  help RET t=) to start the built-in tutorial.

* Your settings
* Installation
To install the latest Emacs, version 24.4, follow this tutorial:

* Structure
There are two main methods for Emacs customization.
One is by writing /Emacs Lisp/ code in =$HOME/.emacs= file and the other is using /Customize/, a built in graphical functionality.
Choosing Customize may seem the easy way as it is more conventional, but in the long run the manual approach is preferable for the following reasons:
- not all variables can be customized through Customize
- no way to define and use own functions with Customize
- any solution for any question is posted as Emacs Lisp code by the community, that you copy, paste  into your =.emacs= file
- ready Emacs Lisp solutions for virtually any purpose

Emacs is extensible through packages. Many are a part of the Emacs distribution, but an ample of them is offered by the community and can be installed separately.
In a nutshell, installing a package is putting in a place where Emacs sees it.
By default it is =$HOME/.emacs.d/= directory.

Because of flexibility of Emacs, =.emacs= file tends to grow in time and at some point becomes very messy.
A good practice to organize it is splitting it into multiple file.
I will have all my customization in =$HOME/.emacs.d/sg_init/= directory.

- =loadpackages.el= :: file has the list of needed packages and installs them if they are not installed
- =visuals.el= :: has the customization of how emacs looks, i.e. color themes, nicer mode line, fonts.
- =keybindings.el= :: try to guess
- =misc.el= :: small global tweaks like making the mini buffer smarter, adding functionality to Dired (the file manager), automatic line wrapping, etc.
- =<mode>settings.el= :: a set of files customizing a certain <mode>, like Org, \LaTeX, Python, etc.

* Loading packages
The best way to install a package is from within Emacs through a package repository.
There are three main repositories. The default GNU repository (/ELPA/),  /MELPA/ and /Marmalade/.

* Visual appearance

** Fonts
I use two fonts, one variable width and one fixed width for code:
1. Noto Sans
2. Droid Sans Mono

Get them here:
http://www.google.com/fonts/

To install these system wise, extract the downloaded ZIP archives into
: /usr/share/fonts
and then run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo fc-cache -f
#+END_SRC

To install it locally (say, if you don't have sudo access), put the fonts in
: ~/.fonts
and then do
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fc-cache -f
#+END_SRC
Note, that you may need to create that folder first.

** Whiteroom for distraction free writing
Just press =F9= to see it

** Workgroups2 and desktop
For having multiple window setups (e.g. Org with agenda,  Python IDE,  R IDE) and restoring the buffers automatically.

*** TODO add an =.emacs_workgroups= to the repo
* TODO Custom key bindings
+ =C-<scroll>= :: change font style
+ =S-<scroll>= :: change font size
+ =F9= :: writeroom
+ =F11= :: toggle fullscreen (Emacs 24.4)
+ =M-q= :: toggle line wrapping
+ =C-x <arrows> :: move between Emacs windows (splits of the Emacs window)
+ ... :: ...

* Org-mode

** TODO Export to LaTeX
The SG styles for manuscripts and Beamer presentations are set up.
It is set up to run the necessary LaTeX, BibTeX sequence with the help of =rubber=.
You can install it with
: sudo apt-get install rubber
Otherwise, you can customize it to use =latexmk=, that you probably have shipped with the \TeX distribution

** Org-gcal
Taken from https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el

1. Go to [[https://console.developers.google.com/project][Google Developers Console]]

2. Create a project (with any name)

3. Click on the project

4. Click on *APIs & Auth* then *Credentials*

5. Click on *Create New Client ID* with Application type /Installed application/, Installed application type /Other/

6. Click on *Create Client ID*

7. Record the Client ID and Client secret for setup.

8. Under the same *APIs & Auth* menu section, select *APIs*

9. Scroll down to *Calendar API*. Click the *Status* button to enable calendar API access to the app you created in steps 5 & 6.

   Go to [[https://www.google.com/calendar/render][Google setting page]] to check the calendar ID.

10. Go to [[https://www.google.com/calendar/render][Google setting page]] and click the gear-shaped settings icon in the upper right, then select "Settings" from the drop down list.

11. Select the "Calendars" tab, which will display a list of your calendars.

12. Select the calendar you would like to synchronize with. This will take you to the "Calendar Details" page for that calendar. Near the end is a section titled "Calendar Address". Following the XML, ICAL, and HTML tags, you will see your Calendar ID.

13. Copy the Calendar ID for use in the settings below, where you will use it as the first element in the org-gcal-file-alist for associating calendars with specific org files. You can associate different calendars with different org files, so repeat this for each calendar you want to use.

*** Setting example

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-gcal)
(setq org-gcal-client-id "your-id-foo.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      org-gcal-client-secret "your-secret"
      org-gcal-file-alist '(("your-mail@gmail.com" .  "~/schedule.org")
                            ("another-mail@gmail.com" .  "~/task.org")))
#+end_src

* Miscellaneous
- You can seamlessly work remotely with TRAMP e.g. like this
  :  C-x d /ssh:yname@machine.com:/home/yname
